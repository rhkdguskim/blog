## From Chatbots to Agents

We are moving beyond simple Q&A bots to autonomous agents capable of performing tasks.

### OpenAI Codex
The engine behind GitHub Copilot. It translates natural language into code, effectively acting as a pair programmer.

### Google Gemini
A multimodal powerhouse. Gemini doesn't just understand text; it processes code, images, and video, making it a versatile agent for complex workflows.

### Anthropic Claude
Known for its massive context window and safety focus. Claude excels at analyzing large codebases and providing nuanced, distinct responses.

The future is multi-agent systems where these specialized AIs work together.

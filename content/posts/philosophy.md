## Can Machines Think?

Alan Turing asked this decades ago. Today, as AI passes the Turing Test in many forms, the question shifts to: *Do they understand?*

### The Chinese Room Argument
Searle's famous thought experiment suggests that syntactic processing (manipulating symbols) is not the same as semantic understanding (knowing meaning).

### AI Alignment
Ensuring AI goals align with human values is not just a technical problem, but a deeply philosophical one. What values do we prioritize? Who decides?

As we build smarter entities, we reflect on our own nature as thinking beings.

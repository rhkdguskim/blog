## Why Prompt Engineering Matters

As LLMs become more powerful, the ability to direct them precisely becomes a critical skill. It's not just about asking questions; it's about setting context, defining constraints, and iterating towards perfection.

### Key Techniques
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples to guide the model.
- **Chain of Thought**: Asking the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step.
- **Role Playing**: Assigning a persona to the AI.

Effective prompting bridges the gap between human intent and machine execution.
